# AIProject
This project predicts body fat percentage using linear regression based on chest and abdomen measurements.
Built in Google Colab with Python, it uses pandas for data handling, scikit-learn for modeling, and matplotlib for 3D visualization of actual vs predicted results. 
The model's performance is evaluated using mean squared error and R-squared.
